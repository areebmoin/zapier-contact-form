# Processing form data with Zapier
This is a very simple project starter for [my article](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/form-data-with-zapier/) on using Zapier to process form data.

## What's included
- Nothing but an `index.html` file containing the project code.

## Getting Started
- Read [this tutorial](https://harrycresswell.com/articles/form-data-with-zapier/) first
- add your own CSS and class names so you can style your form
- Update the `URL` in the Ajax call to your Zapier Webhook URL
- Update the `window.location` URL to redirect to a success page of your choice.

## Live Demo
