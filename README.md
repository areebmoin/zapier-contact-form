# Processing form data with Zapier

This is a very simple project starter for [my article](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/processing-form-data-on-your-static-site-with-zapier/) on using Zapier to process form data.

## What's included
- Nothing but an `index.html` file containing the project code.

## Getting Started
- Read [this tutorial](https://www.harrycresswell.com/articles/processing-form-data-on-your-static-site-with-zapier/) first
- add your own CSS and class names so you can style your form
- Update the URL to your Zapier webhook URL
- Update the `window.location` URL to redirect to a success page of your choice.
